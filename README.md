Dataset Description:

There are many open source datasets available for this problem, like Flickr 8k (containing8k images), Flickr 30k (containing 30k images), MS COCO (containing 180k images), etc. I have used the Flickr 8k dataset because it is a good starting dataset as it is small in size and can be trained easily on low-end laptops/desktops using a CPU.
